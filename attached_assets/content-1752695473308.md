# How Fastlane Works

Fastlane is PayPal’s quick guest checkout solution. It securely saves and retrieves payment and shipping information for Fastlane members. Fastlane members enter their email and receive pre-filled checkout forms.

## Consumer Benefits:

- Members can enter their email address and receive autofilled checkout forms.

- Members can securely check out with their email address at any site that integrates Fastlane.

- No password required. Members get a one-time confirmation code after entering their email address.

Fastlane is a separate profile from a PayPal account and is meant to augment your existing PayPal integration and allow guests to enjoy faster checkouts in a lightweight manner.

Workflow for integrating PayPal Fastlane Checkout.

1

The script tag fetches the PayPal JS SDK to render the checkout page. You create a client token for the session.

2

The buyer enters the email address on the client side.

3

PayPal checks if the email is associated with a Fastlane profile and triggers the guest or member flow.

Guest Flow:

1

The email is not associated with a Fastlane profile. The customer enters their payment information and shipping address.

2

The payment information is tokenized and sent to PayPal along with other information entered.

3

The information is passed in an Orders API capture request and the response is sent to the merchant.

Member Flow:

1

The email is associated with a Fastlane profile. PayPal retrieves payment and shipping information.

2

The buyer confirms information and pays. The payment is tokenized and sent to PayPal with the info.

3

The information is passed in an Orders API capture request and a response is sent to the merchant.

How Fastlane speeds up guest checkout flow

After a user signs up for Fastlane, they enter their email to get the member flow at any site with a Fastlane integration.

2\. Guest is prompted to enter their email address.

## Set up your development environment

scroll leftscroll right

1

Install Node.js and npm

This sample integration uses Node.js version 18 or higher and npm as the package manager.

- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)


2

Install dependencies

1. Use the terminal to navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2. Run `npm init` to initialize the `package.json ` file.

3. Fill in each request information and press **Enter** to proceed.

4. Install required dependencies by executing `npm install express dotenv cors consolidate mustache`.
   - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) separates your configuration and code by loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

   - [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is a Node.js web application framework supports web and mobile applications.

   - [mustache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache) (with [consolidate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/consolidate)) is a lightweight way to generate static HTML pages from templates.

   - [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) is a node.js package for providing express.js a middleware that can be used to enable [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) with various options.

Verify `package.json`

The following code sample shows a package.json file for a PayPal integration:

```
{
  "name": "test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "consolidate": "^1.0.4",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "express": "^4.21.1",
    "mustache": "^4.2.0"
  }
}

```

Set up `.env`

Use a `.env` file to set your local working environment variables and securely pass the client ID and client secret for your app.

The following code shows an example .env file. Replace the `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` with values from your app. Replace `DOMAINS` with a comma-separated list of the domain name(s) where Fastlane will be presented.

PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_ID=YOUR\_CLIENT\_ID\_HERE

PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_SECRET=YOUR\_CLIENT\_SECRET\_HERE

DOMAINS=YOUR\_DOMAINS\_HERE

View your client ID and client secret in the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.paypal.com%2Fdashboard%2F&intent=developer&ctxId=ul642d80e87cb74e0ea12c423476c5ea50&_ga=2.267858766.1110484507.1727971327-375239276.1721332164) under **Apps & Credentials**.
