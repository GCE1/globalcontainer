# How do I create PayPal REST API credentials?

Here's how you generate REST API credentials:

1. Log in to the [PayPal Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com/) using the same credentials you use for [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/).
2. On the [Apps & Credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox) page, click **Live** or **Sandbox** depending on whether you need an app for testing (Sandbox) or going live (Live).
3. Click **Create App** in the upper right corner.
4. Enter the name of your REST API app in the **App Name** field, select **Merchant** or **Platform** as the type of application, and select a **Sandbox business account** to associate with your app.
5. Click **Create App**.


    Your credentials, the client ID and secret, are displayed on the app details page that displays after you click **Create App**.
6. Request permissions for REST API features that apply to your integration, such as:
   - Invoicing API
   - PayPal Here
   - Subscriptions
   - PayPal payments
   - Connect with PayPal
   - Customer Disputes API
   - Payouts
   - Advanced Credit & Debit Cards
   - Vault
7. When you are ready to take your code live, make sure to [move your application to Live](https://developer.paypal.com/reference/production/).
