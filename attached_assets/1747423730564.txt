### **AI Implementation Prompt for Wholesale Section**  
**Task:**  
Design and implement a **paid-member-exclusive Wholesale Section** for our container leasing platform, enabling bulk leasing with tiered pricing, custom quotes, and premium support.  

**Requirements:**  
1. **Access Control:**  
   - Lock the section behind a paywall, accessible only to users with active "Wholesale" or "Enterprise" membership tiers.  
   - Integrate Stripe/PayPal API for subscription verification or use role-based authentication (e.g., user.role = "paid_wholesale").  

2. **Core Features:**  
   - **Bulk Inventory Dashboard:**  
     - Display real-time availability of 20ft/40ft containers with filters (location, price, quantity).  
     - Dynamic pricing table showing volume discounts (e.g., "Lease 50+ containers: 15% discount").  
   - **Quote Request Tool:**  
     - Form fields: Container type, quantity, lease duration, delivery address.  
     - AI-generated price estimates based on market rates and user history.  
   - **Member Benefits:**  
     - Priority 24/7 support chat.  
     - Downloadable contracts and bulk leasing guides.  

3. **UI/UX:**  
   - Minimalist design with:  
     - Clear "Upgrade to Access" prompts for non-members.  
     - Interactive inventory table (sort by price/availability).  
     - "Request Quote" CTAs with auto-filled user data (e.g., saved company details).  

4. **Backend Logic:**  
   - Automate discount calculations:  
     ```python  
     def calculate_discount(quantity):  
         if quantity >= 100: return 0.2  # 20% off  
         elif quantity >= 50: return 0.15  
         else: return 0  
     ```  
   - Log analytics on popular routes/container types for future pricing adjustments.  

5. **Security:**  
   - Encrypt all transaction data.  
   - Rate-limit API calls to prevent wholesale price scraping.  

**Output Deliverables:**  
- Wireframe mockups of the Wholesale Dashboard (desktop/mobile).  
- Sample API schema for membership verification.  
- Pseudocode for dynamic pricing logic.  

**Optional Enhancements:**  
- Tiered membership levels (e.g., Gold: +5% discount on 100+ leases).  
- Multi-language support for global clients.
