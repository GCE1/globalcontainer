Insights Page
The Insights Page will provide a dashboard showing all locations where containers are being leased, including origin and destination data, and monthly averaged pickup charges. It will exclude company-specific information to maintain privacy.

Implementation Steps:
Plugin: Use WP Data Tables or Advanced Custom Fields Pro (ACF Pro) for data visualization.
Features:
Dynamic Location Map:
Use Google Maps API (via plugins like WP Google Maps) to display container origin and destination points.
Each point on the map will represent a leasing transaction.
Monthly Averages:
Use WooCommerce Analytics or a custom query to calculate the average pickup charges per month.
Display this data in a table or chart using a plugin like Chart.js Integration.
Filters:
Allow users to filter by location, date range, or container type.
Use FacetWP or Filter Everything to implement advanced filtering options.
2. Dynamic Container Page
The Dynamic Container Page will allow customers to add their own containers via a form and manage their inventory. The inventory will include location details and sync with their profile.

Implementation Steps:
Plugin: Use Gravity Forms or WPForms for the submission form, and ACF Pro for dynamic content display.
Features:
Container Submission Form:
Fields for container details, including:
Container type, size, and condition.
Current location (origin and destination).
Availability status.
Automatically save submitted data to the user’s profile.
Inventory Management:
Use Custom Post Types (via ACF or CPT UI) to store container data.
Display a dashboard where users can view, edit, or delete their containers.
Sync with Profile:
Link the submitted containers to the user’s account.
Use User Meta or Profile Builder Pro to store and display inventory data in their profile.
Dynamic Listings:
Containers added by users can optionally be published as public listings (if enabled by the user).
3. Invoice Page
The Invoice Page will help customers keep their books up to date by automatically generating and managing invoices for their transactions.

Implementation Steps:
Plugin: Use WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips or Sprout Invoices.
Features:
Automatic Invoice Generation:
Generate invoices automatically for each transaction.
Include details such as container type, pickup charges, per diem rates, and total cost.
Invoice Management:
Allow users to view, download, and print invoices from their profile.
Create a dedicated invoice page that summarizes all transactions.
Tax and Compliance:
Add tax calculations and compliance features for different regions.
Use plugins like TaxJar for automated tax calculations.
Export Options:
Allow users to export invoice data as CSV or Excel files for bookkeeping.
4. Email Management System
The Email Management System will allow customers to send and receive emails from their own customers. Emails will be redirected to specific tabs for easy management.

Implementation Steps:
Plugin: Use FluentCRM or WP Mail SMTP Pro for email management.
Features:
Customer Communication:
Allow users to send and receive emails directly from the platform.
Create a simple email interface for composing, replying, and forwarding emails.
Redirect Emails to Tabs:
Organize emails into tabs such as “Inbox,” “Sent,” “Drafts,” and “Archived.”
Use Custom Post Types to store and display emails in these tabs.
Email Templates:
Provide pre-designed templates for common email types (e.g., transaction confirmations, inquiries).
Email Notifications:
Notify users when they receive a new email.
Use Push Notifications (via OneSignal) for real-time updates.
Email Attachments:
Allow users to attach files (e.g., contracts, invoices) to their emails.
Email Analytics:
Track email open rates, click-through rates, and response times for better communication insights.
