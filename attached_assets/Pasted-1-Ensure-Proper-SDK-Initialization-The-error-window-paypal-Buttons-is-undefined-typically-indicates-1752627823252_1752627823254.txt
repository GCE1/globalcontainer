1. Ensure Proper SDK Initialization
The error window.paypal.Buttons is undefined typically indicates that the PayPal SDK hasn't loaded correctly. This can occur if the SDK script is not included or if it's loaded asynchronously before the PayPalButtons component is rendered.

Solution: Use the @paypal/react-paypal-js package, which manages the SDK loading for you. Here's how to set it up:

import { PayPalScriptProvider, PayPalButtons } from "@paypal/react-paypal-js";

const App = () => (
  <PayPalScriptProvider options={{ "client-id": "your-client-id" }}>
    <PayPalButtons />
  </PayPalScriptProvider>
);
Ensure that the client-id is correctly set and that the PayPalScriptProvider wraps your component tree.

2. Check for Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues
A restrictive CSP can block the loading of external scripts, including the PayPal SDK.

Solution: Update your CSP to allow scripts from PayPal's domains. For example:

js
Copy
Edit
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://www.paypal.com;
Adjust the policy according to your application's requirements.

3. Verify Environment Compatibility
Ensure that your development environment supports dynamic script loading. Some bundlers or server configurations might interfere with this process.

Solution: Test your application in a production-like environment to rule out development-specific issues.

4. Handle Undefined paypal.Buttons Gracefully
In some cases, paypal.Buttons might be undefined due to timing issues.

Solution: Check for the existence of paypal.Buttons before using it:

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (window.paypal && window.paypal.Buttons) {
  window.paypal.Buttons().render("#paypal-button-container");
} else {
  console.error("PayPal Buttons SDK not loaded.");
}
This ensures that your application doesn't attempt to use the PayPal Buttons component before it's available.

Test the Application: Run your application and verify that the PayPal Buttons render correctly without errors.
